# GenPRo

## Introduction
GenPRo is a project dedicated to making General Purpose Robots(GenPRo) accessible to everyone. We believe that the future is one where robots are not just tools for industry, but integral parts of our daily lives. Whether it's assisting with household chores, providing companionship, or aiding in professional tasks, GenPRo aims to create versatile embodied-AI robots that can be adapted to a wide range of needs.

## Our Vision
Our vision is a world where everyone can benefit from the capabilities of General Purpose Robots(GenPRo). We strive to break down barriers to entry, making it easy for developers, hobbyists, and everyday users to interact with and utilize robotic technology.

## Key Features
- **Open Source**: We believe in the power of community. That's why GenPRo is open source, allowing anyone to contribute, modify, and improve the robots.
- **User-Friendly**: Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, GenPRo is designed to be easy to use. Our intuitive interfaces and comprehensive documentation make it accessible to all.
- **Versatility**: GenPRo robots can be programmed for a variety of tasks, from simple automation to complex problem-solving. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.
- **Modularity**: GenPRo robots are designed with modularity in mind. This means you can easily customize and upgrade components to suit your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements
To get started with GenPRo, you'll need the following hardware components:

- **Main Control Board**: This is the brain of the robot, responsible for processing and executing commands.
- **Sensors**: Depending on your use case, you may need various sensors such as cameras, microphones, and distance sensors.
- **Actuators**: These are the components that enable the robot to move and interact with its environment.
- **Power Supply**: A reliable power source is essential for keeping your robot running.

### Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: GenPRo is compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Linux and Windows.
- **Programming Languages**: We recommend using Python or C++ for programming your GenPRo robot.
- **Development Environment**: You'll need a code editor or IDE to write and test your code.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the GenPRo repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GenPRo/GenPRo.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the instructions in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section to install all necessary software and libraries.

3. **Configure the Robot**: Use the provided configuration files to set up your robot's hardware and software components.
